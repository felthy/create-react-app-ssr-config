Server Side Rendering with Create React App üôå
==============================================

‚úÖ Updated for Create React App v3.4.1

This repository was bootstrapped with [Create React App][1], [ejected][3], then configured to perform Server Side
Rendering (SSR).

If you‚Äôre interested in SSR then you‚Äôd be aware that Create React App has no plans to include support for it:

> _Ultimately server side rendering is very hard to add in a meaningful way without also taking opinionated decisions.
> We don‚Äôt intend to make such decisions at this time._‚Ää ‚Äî‚Ää[Dan Abramov][4]

This repository, then, is my minimally-opinionated SSR configuration, sticking closely to Create React App‚Äôs style and
introducing as few new things (packages, code, configuration) as possible.

Philosophy
----------

- **Minimal intervention**: Minimise changes to Create React App‚Äôs configuration, so that reviewing [the diff][5] can
  clearly illustrate the requirements of SSR;
- **Developer experience**: Retain the cohesive curated experience provided by Create React App - in particular, you
  shouldn‚Äôt need to do a production build to test your SSR code path.

How to use it
-------------

1. Follow the Create React App [instructions][2] to create a new project;
2. [Eject][3];
3. View [the diff][5] and apply the same changes to your project, by hand or [as a patch][6];
4. Run `yarn` to update dependencies;
5. Run `yarn start` or `yarn build` as normal.

> **Note**: the diff and patch links here compare the HEAD of the master branch to the [commit][7] immediately after
> ejecting, so they will stay up to date if/when new commits are pushed to this repo.

I recommend applying the changes by hand, rather than forking or otherwise copying this repo, so that you benefit from
the latest version of Create React App (and to see first-hand what the configuration changes are!).

If you use [the patch][6], be sure to review the changes after applying, to make sure it all makes sense with the
current version of Create React App‚Äôs scripts and configuration.

Running in production
---------------------

To run in production, run `yarn build` then deploy at least the following files and folders:

- `build/`
- `config/`
- `scripts/`
- `package.json`
- `yarn.lock`

If the server‚Äôs environment has `NODE_ENV=production` set, then run `yarn install` to install dependencies then use
`node scripts/start.js` (or `yarn start`) to launch the server process (which you‚Äôll probably want to do via tools like
[Nodemon][23] and [pm2][24]).

If your server doesn‚Äôt already have `NODE_ENV=production` set in its environment, then use `yarn install --prod` and
`NODE_ENV=production node scripts/start.js` (or `yarn start:prod`) instead.

> **Note**: the dependencies in `package.json` have been split into devDependencies and normal runtime dependencies,
> so running `yarn install --prod` (or running with `NODE_ENV=production`) will not install any libraries that aren‚Äôt
> needed in a production environment. That mostly means the webpack infrastructure.

Things to ignore in the diff
----------------------------

- `README.md` (the file you‚Äôre reading now)
- `.editorconfig` (although I do recommend [using one][8])
- version numbers in `package.json` (use `yarn add` to add the new dependencies so you get the current versions)
- `yarn.lock` (yours will be regenerated when you run `yarn`)

How it works
------------

### Overview

- `yarn start` is used for both the local dev server (the default) and in production;
- The file `index.html` is removed, and the html received by the browser is constructed instead by the express
  middleware in `src/server/index.js` (including pre-rendering the React component tree on the server) in both local dev
  and production;
- In the client code, `ReactDOM.render()` is changed to `ReactDOM.hydrate()`;
- `yarn build` is used (as usual) to prepare a build for production, and must be run before `yarn start` can be used
  in production;
- During local development, code changes are automatically recompiled and reloaded in your browser - even the code in
  `src/server/`.

> **Note**: As with Create React App, only CSS changes are hot-reloaded without a browser refresh.  If you‚Äôre interested
> in improving your hot-module-replacement experience, try [vanilla webpack HMR][29] first, especially if you don‚Äôt need
> to preserve component state (e.g. you use [Redux][30]). That‚Äôs simply a matter of:
>   1. Run `yarn add -D webpack-hot-middleware`. (This is required because [create-react-app][1]‚Äôs HMR client doesn‚Äôt
>      understand multiple compiler configurations, so forces a full refresh on every code update).
>   2. Add the below code to `src/index.js`:
```javascript
module.hot.accept('./App', () => {
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
});
```
>   3. In `server.dev.js`, add `const webpackHotMiddleware = require('webpack-hot-middleware');` at the top,
>      and `app.use(webpackHotMiddleware(compiler.compilers[0]));` as the first line of `serverConfig.after()`.
>
> If that‚Äôs not enough for your use case, and you are brave, try [react-hot-loader][14].

### Webpack configuration

- `webpack.config.js` is changed to export an [[array] of configurations][12], containing configuration for the client
  and server builds respectively;
- The configurations are named `client` and `server`, which is a requirement of [webpack-hot-server-middleware][11];
- Configuration related to the `index.html` file is deleted;
- The [stats-webpack-plugin][18] is added to the production config (so that the server can find out things, like the
  filenames of generated assets, at runtime);
- The server configuration is created by copying the client configuration and then changing some things. The changes
  are done by code in `config/webpack.config.server.common.js` and mostly involve disabling tasks that don‚Äôt need to
  be repeated in the server build:
  - don‚Äôt emit static assets (images, css etc.);
  - don‚Äôt build the [service worker][15] file;
  - don‚Äôt minify the code;
  - don‚Äôt inline `process.env` settings into the bundle.

### `config/webpackDevServer.config.js`

- Get the client configuration from the configuration array now that the project uses [multiple configurations][12];
- Turn off the [history API fallback][16], because that is now the responsibility of the server code in `src/server/`;
- Change the order in which the Webpack Dev Server initializes things, for compatibility with
  [webpack-hot-server-middleware][11] (explained in more detail [in a comment][17]).

### `scripts/start.js`

The code that is specific to local development has been moved into `scripts/server.dev.js`, so that `start.js` can be
used to start the server in production as well.

### `scripts/server.dev.js`

Initializes the Webpack Dev Server. Unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt find a good way to link to a visual diff between the
original `start.js` and the new `server.dev.js` but if you use a tool of your own, such as the compare function in an
IDE, you‚Äôll see that it is made up of fragments from the original `start.js` with only a few additions:

- Use the `after` hook to mount the [webpack-hot-server-middleware][11], and the same error handling middleware that
  will be used in production;
- Add a workaround to fix hot replacement of CSS changes, due to the Webpack Dev Server‚Äôs hot replacement code not
  handling [multiple configurations][12] correctly.

### `scripts/server.prod.js`

This file is all new, and basically it initializes an [Express][19] server to:

- serve the static assets generated by the client build, and
- pass all other requests through to the SSR middleware in `src/server/index.js`.

It also includes a quick check that you‚Äôve run `yarn build`, and if the assets aren‚Äôt found then it attempts to run the
build script itself before proceeding.

> **Note**: This automatic build won‚Äôt work if `yarn install` was executed in an environment where `NODE_ENV` was set to
> `production`, because the webpack infrastructure won‚Äôt be present.

### `scripts/build.js`

- Remove references to `index.html`;
- Use the client configuration when measuring asset sizes, now that the project uses [multiple configurations][12].

### The SSR middleware: `src/server/*`

This code is all new, with the most interesting work happening in `src/server/middleware/render.js`. That‚Äôs where the
html is constructed by:

- Constructing `<link>` tags for any CSS assets output by the build (code adapted from [html-webpack-plugin][20]);
- Constructing a `<script>` tag for the main client bundle;
- Populating React‚Äôs mount `<div>` with the output from `renderToString()`.

You‚Äôll want to add things like [prerendered Redux state][21], or prerendered CSS from a CSS-in-JS technology like
[JSS][22], here.

Known issues
------------

During local development, you will see a [FOUC][25] (Flash Of Unstyled Content) between the browser‚Äôs initial paint and
when the client Javascript inserts the CSS into the DOM. This does not occur in production.

The FOUC is inherent to the CSS configuration adopted by Create React App (i.e. the use of [style-loader][26] to support
hot module replacement during development), but it isn‚Äôt an issue without SSR because without SSR you can‚Äôt see anything
at all until the client Javascript has executed!

Personally, in my projects I delete the CSS configuration and use [JSS][27] instead. When using JSS and Redux, hot
reloading is clean and seamless.

Acknowledgements
----------------

Many thanks to [@faceyspacey][9] for [universal-demo][10], which introduced me to [webpack-hot-server-middleware][11]
and the idea of using [multiple Webpack configurations][12] to build the client and server code at the same time üëç.
